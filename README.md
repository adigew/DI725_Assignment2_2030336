In this assignment we will be detecting objects in a remote sensing dataset. Object detection is a fundamental
computer vision task that aims to locate objects and classify them simultaneously within an image frame. The
spatial location of objects of interest are typically represented by a bounding box that encloses each object
instance. Bounding boxes are typically represented with coordinates (x min, y min, x max, y max) or (x center,
y center, width, height). After locating objects of interest, each object is assigned a class label.

The dataset we are going to use is the AU-AIR dataset.
You can read the details of the dataset from the official research report.(https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11737)
